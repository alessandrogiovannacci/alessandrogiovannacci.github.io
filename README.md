# About me
I'm a software engineer with a great passion for computer science and specifically software engineering field.

I currently work as a backend software engineer at Arca24.com. My course of study at Università degli studi dell’Insubria provided a specialization in the **software engineering’s field**, as well as in **data management, analysis and security**.

What can I say about me with few words? I am curious, I want to understand how things work, and I always want to learn new things. I have many interests: games, reading, running, just to name a few. I am also very interested about what concerns the universe: this is due to various science documentaries I watched over the years, stimulating my curiosity about what’s outside of the Earth. I am a passionate gamer from the age of 6, my favourite genres are RPG and FPS. I play a lot in my spare time. I also like logic games (like Skyscrapers or Sudoku), enigmatography (like Rebus), strategy board games.

# Projects

### Java plugin for Cameo Systems Modeler

*Description*: [INAF](http://www.inaf.it/it) (National Institute for Astrophysics) required a software system that simplifies the generation of a specific file in Cameo Systems Modeler context: the report. The first task is the creation of a Velocity template, which is a specific file that contains a VTL script. Once the template file has been created, the configuration of the Report Wizard is fundamental, because the entire report generation process can be customized, specifying the scope from which the diagram extrapolation must begin, as well as setting the Report data, a collection of report which can be included in the generated report, and output options. The last step is the implementation of a Cameo Systems Modeler plugin, using the Java language. CSM is mainly written in Java, and developers made available a specific Application Programming Interface (API) through which extensions can be written and included in the software.

### Watchneighbors

*Description*: Stand-alone Java application that monitors the neighborhood. This application lets the user report abnormal events, visualize them and take them in charge. Users can visualize reports list of their neighborhood. Data retention is carried out through csv files.

A smaller version of Watchneighbors has been created in MIPS-32 assembly language, it can be executed in [SPIM simulator](https://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).

### seatIn

*Description*: Client-server application developed with Java technology. It is the acronym of simple e-learning at Insubria; the software recreates a typical e-learning platform, where professors, students and administrators login with their username and password, share files, update their profiles, visualize information about courses provided by the university. Used technologies: RMI for client/server communication, PostgreSQL for storing and managing data, JDBC for interfacing Java app with DBMS.

### GMaker

*Descripion*: Software written in Java; it lets the user create graphs by defining ordered sets. GMaker requires Graphviz, a graph generator application, that allows to generate graphs that are initially represented as files with dot extension. GMaker generates a file with dot extension, and this file is the input for the program that render it, and generates a graph drawing, or equivalently, the Hasse diagram; at this point, GMaker takes care of showing to the user the generated graph. Various graphs can be generated, as they represent different algebraic structures: partition of a set, down-sets of a poset, disjoined down-sets of a poset, join-irreducible elements set of a poset.
