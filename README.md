# About me
I'm a software engineer with a great passion for computer science and specifically software engineering field.

I currently work as a backend software engineer at Arca24.com. My course of study at Università degli studi dell’Insubria provided a specialization in the **software engineering’s field**, as well as in **data management, analysis and security**.

What can I say about me with few words? I am curious, I want to understand how things work, and I always want to learn new things. I have many interests: games, reading, running, just to name a few. I am also very interested about what concerns the universe: this is due to various science documentaries I watched over the years, stimulating my curiosity about what’s outside of the Earth. I am a passionate gamer from the age of 6, my favourite genres are RPG and FPS. I play a lot in my spare time. I also like logic games (like Skyscrapers or Sudoku), enigmatography (like Rebus), strategy board games.
